# Movie Trailer Website

This project generates an HTML file (fresh_tomatoes.html) that produces a website to showcase the four sci-fi horror movies produced by J.J. Abrams and provides links to their YouTube trailers.

# Install

-   Install Python 3 ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
-   Save the Python scripts **entertainment_center.py**, **media.py** and **fresh_tomatoes.py** attached in the submission in a folder of your choice

# How to run?

From your shell (and folder where the Python scripts are saved), run:

    Python3 entertainment_center.py

The generated HTML file will be saved in the folder and the website will be rendered by your default browser.

The Python scripts **entertainment_center.py**, **media.py** and **fresh_tomatoes.py** are released under the MIT License.
